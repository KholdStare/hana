    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Comparable` concept defines equality and inequality.
    //!
    //! Intuitively, `Comparable` objects must define a binary predicate named
    //! `equal` that returns whether both objects represent the same abstract
    //! value. In other words, `equal` must check for deep equality. Since
    //! "representing the same abstract value" is difficult to express
    //! formally, the exact meaning of equality is partially left to
    //! interpretation by the programmer with the following guidelines:\n
    //! 1. Equality should be compatible with copy construction; copy
    //!    constructing a value yields an `equal` value.
    //! 2. Equality should be independent of representation; an object
    //!    representing the fraction `0/2` should be `equal` to an object
    //!    representing `0/4`, because they both represent the mathematical
    //!    object `0`.
    //!
    //! Moreover, `equal` must exhibit properties that make it intuitive to
    //! use for determining the equivalence of objects, which is formalized
    //! by the following laws.
    //!
    //!
    //! Laws
    //! ----
    //! `equal` must define an [equivalence relation][1], and `not_equal` must
    //! be its complement. In other words, for all objects `a`, `b`, `c` of a
    //! `Comparable` data type, the following must be true (where `x == y` and
    //! `x != y` denote `equal(x, y)` and `not_equal(x, y)`, respectively):
    //! @code
    //!     a == a                          // Reflexivity
    //!     if a == b then b == a           // Symmetry
    //!     if a == b && b == c then a == c // Transitivity
    //!     a != b is equivalent to !(a == b)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! 1. `equal`\n
    //! When `equal` is defined, `not_equal` is implemented by default as its
    //! complement. For all objects `x`, `y` of a `Comparable` data type,
    //! @code
    //!     not_equal(x, y) == not_(equal(x, y))
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Provided models
    //! ---------------
    //! 1. For `EqualityComparable` data types\n
    //! Two data types `T` and `U` that model the cross-type EqualityComparable
    //! concept presented in [N3351][2] automatically model the `Comparable`
    //! concept by setting
    //! @code
    //!     equal(x, y) = (x == y)
    //! @endcode
    //! Note that this also makes EqualityComparable types in the
    //! [usual sense][3] models of `Comparable` in the same way.
    //!
    //!
    //! Operators
    //! ---------
    //! For convenience, the following operators are provided as an
    //! equivalent way of calling the corresponding method:
    //! @code
    //!     ==  ->  equal
    //!     !=  ->  not_equal
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Equality-preserving functions
    //! -----------------------------
    //! Let `A` and `B` be two `Comparable` data types. A function
    //! @f$ f : A \to B @f$ is said to be equality-preserving if it preserves
    //! the structure of the `Comparable` concept, which can be rigorously
    //! stated as follows. For all objects `x`, `y` of data type `A`,
    //! @code
    //!     if  equal(x, y)  then  equal(f(x), f(y))
    //! @endcode
    //! Equivalently, we simply require that `f` is a function in the usual
    //! mathematical sense. Another property is [injectivity][4], which can be
    //! viewed as being a "lossless" mapping. This property can be stated as
    //! @code
    //!     if  equal(f(x), f(y))  then  equal(x, y)
    //! @endcode
    //! This is equivalent to saying that `f` maps distinct elements to
    //! distinct elements, hence the "lossless" analogy. In other words, `f`
    //! will not collapse distinct elements from its domain into a single
    //! element in its image, thus losing information.
    //!
    //! These functions are very important, especially equality-preserving
    //! ones, because they allow us to reason simply about programs. Also
    //! note that the property of being equality-preserving is taken for
    //! granted in mathematics because it is part of the definition of a
    //! function. We feel it is important to make the distinction here
    //! because programming has evolved differently and as a result
    //! programmers are used to work with functions that do not preserve
    //! equality.
    //!
    //!
    //! Cross-type version of the methods
    //! ---------------------------------
    //! The `equal` and `not_equal` methods are "overloaded" to handle
    //! distinct data types with certain properties. Specifically, they
    //! are defined for _distinct_ data types `A` and `B` such that
    //! 1. `A` and `B` share a common data type `C`, as determined by the
    //!    `common` metafunction
    //! 2. `A`, `B` and `C` are all `Comparable` when taken individually
    //! 3. @f$ \mathrm{to<C>} : A \to C @f$ and @f$\mathrm{to<C>} : B \to C@f$
    //!    are both equality-preserving and injective (i.e. they are embeddings),
    //!    as determined by the `is_embedding` metafunction.
    //!
    //! The method definitions for data types satisfying the above
    //! properties are
    //! @code
    //!     equal(x, y)     = equal(to<C>(x), to<C>(y))
    //!     not_equal(x, y) = not_equal(to<C>(x), to<C>(y))
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Important note: special behavior of `equal`
    //! -------------------------------------------
    //! In the context of programming with heterogeneous values, it is useful
    //! to have unrelated objects compare `false` instead of triggering an
    //! error. For this reason, `equal` adopts a special behavior for
    //! unrelated objects of data types `T` and `U` that do not satisfy the
    //! above requirements for the cross-type overloads. Specifically, when
    //! `T` and `U` are unrelated (i.e. `T` can't be converted to `U` and
    //! vice-versa), comparing objects of those data types yields a
    //! compile-time false value. This has the effect that unrelated objects
    //! like `float` and `std::string` will compare false, while comparing
    //! related objects that can not be safely embedded into the same super
    //! structure (like `long long` and `float` because of the precision loss)
    //! will trigger a compile-time assertion. Also note that for any data type
    //! `T` for which the minimial complete definition of `Comparable` is not
    //! provided, a compile-time assertion will also be triggered because `T`
    //! and `T` trivially share the common data type `T`, which is the expected
    //! behavior. This design choice aims to provide more flexibility for
    //! comparing objects, while still rejecting usage patterns that are
    //! most likely programming errors.
    //!
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! Make sure no circularity issue with our provided operators can arise
    //! when checking for the EqualityComparable concept.

    //! The `equal` function can be called in two different ways. First, it
    //! can be called like a normal function:
    //! @code
    //!     equal(x, y)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! However, it may also be partially applied to an argument by using
    //! `equal.to`:
    //! @code
    //!     equal.to(x)(y) == equal(x, y)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! In other words, `equal.to(x)` is a function object that is equivalent
    //! to `partial(equal, x)`. This is provided to enhance the readability of
    //! some constructs, especially when using higher order algorithms.
    //!
    //!
    //! Signature
    //! ---------
    //! Given a Logical `Bool` and two Comparables `A` and `B` that
    //! share a common embedding, the signature is
    //! @f$ \mathrm{equal} : A \times B \to Bool @f$.

    //! > It is a valid question whether `equal` should accept more than 2
    //! > arguments and have semantics matching those of Python's `==`. This
    //! > is not supported right now for the following reasons:
    //! > - It was implemented in the MPL11, but it was not shown to be useful
    //! >   so far.
    //! > - It does not make sense for `not_equal` to have an arity of more
    //! >   than 2, only `equal` could maybe have those semantics, which would
    //! >   break symmetry.
