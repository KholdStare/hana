namespace boost { namespace hana {
    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Record` concept represents record-like user-defined types.
    //!
    //! A record-like type is any type which is fundamentally a `struct`,
    //! regardless of the implementation of its accessors and other similar
    //! details. In some sence, Records can be seen as maps to which keys
    //! can't be added.
    //!
    //! Models of `Record` are created by specifying an ordered mapping
    //! from keys to accessors, where keys are objects playing the role of
    //! member names, and accessors allow individual members to be retrieved
    //! from an object. Specifically, an accessor `A` for a subobject `sub`
    //! of type `T` inside an object of type `Obj` is a function such that
    //! @code
    //!     A(Obj&)       -> T&
    //!     A(Obj const&) -> T const&
    //!     A(Obj&&)      -> T
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! where `F(X) -> Y` means that the return type of `F` when called with
    //! an object of type `X` is exactly `Y`. Moreover, `A` may only access
    //! and/or modify the subobject `sub`. This restriction exists so that
    //! @code
    //!     Obj obj = {...};
    //!     auto subobject_1 = accessor_1(std::move(obj));
    //!     auto subobject_2 = accessor_2(std::move(obj));
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! is valid code which extracts two subobjects of `obj` while (perhaps)
    //! moving from them. If `accessor_1` was allowed to modify arbitrary
    //! subobjects of `obj`, we could end up accessing a moved-from object
    //! with `accessor_2` (if `accessor_1` had moved from it). Similarly,
    //! if `accessor_2` was allowed to access arbitrary subobjects of `obj`,
    //! it could end up accessing the moved-from subobject that was moved-from
    //! with `accessor_1`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! `members`
    //!
    //! @note
    //! The @ref BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_RECORD and
    //! @ref BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_RECORD_INTRUSIVE macros can
    //! also be used to define models of `Record`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Provided superclass models
    //! --------------------------
    //! 1. `Comparable`\n
    //! Two `Records` of the same data type `R` are equal if and only if
    //! all their members are equal. The members are compared in the
    //! same order as they appear in `members<R>()`.
    //!
    //! 2. `Foldable`\n
    //! Folding a `Record` `R` is equivalent to folding a list of its members,
    //! in the same order as they appear in `members<R>()`.
    //!
    //! 3. `Searchable`\n
    //! Searching a `Record` `r` is equivalent to searching `to<Map>(r)`.
    //!
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! The restrictions on what constitutes an accessor are pretty fierce,
    //! and using `std::move` on the same object twice feels completely wrong.
    //! Is there a better way to allow an object to be decomposed optimally
    //! into its subobjects without resorting to such hacks?
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/record.cpp
    struct Record { };

    //! Returns a list of pairs representing the data structure.
    //! @relates Record
    //!
    //! Specifically, `members<R>()` is a Sequence of `Product`s associating
    //! keys to functions, where a pair `(k, f)` means that the member
    //! represented by the key `k` can be accessed by calling the function
    //! `f` on an object of data type `R`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @include example/record.cpp
