namespace boost { namespace hana {
    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Foldable` concept represents data structures that can be reduced
    //! to a single value.
    //!
    //! Another way of seeing `Foldable` is as data structures supporting
    //! internal iteration with the ability to accumulate a result. By
    //! internal iteration, we mean that the _loop control_ is in the hand
    //! of the structure, not the caller. Hence, it is the structure who
    //! decides when the iteration stops, which is normally when the whole
    //! structure has been consumed. Since C++ is an eager language, this
    //! requires `Foldable` structures to be finite, or otherwise one would
    //! need to loop indefinitely to consume the whole structure.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! While the fact that `Foldable` only works for finite structures may
    //! seem overly restrictive in comparison to the Haskell definition of
    //! `Foldable`, a finer grained separation of the concepts should
    //! mitigate the issue. For iterating over possibly infinite data
    //! structures, see the `Iterable` concept. For searching a possibly
    //! infinite data structure, see the `Searchable` concept.
    //!
    //!
    //! @anchor Foldable-lin
    //! The linearization of a `Foldable`
    //! ---------------------------------
    //! Intuitively, for a `Foldable` structure `xs`, the _linearization_ of
    //! `xs` is the sequence of all the elements in `xs` as if they had been
    //! put in a list:
    //! @code
    //!     linearization(xs) = [x1, x2, ..., xn]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Note that it is always possible to produce such a linearization
    //! for a finite `Foldable` by setting
    //! @code
    //!     linearization(xs) = fold.left(xs, [], prepend)
    //! @endcode
    //! for an appropriate definition of `[]` and `prepend`. The notion of
    //! linearization is useful for expressing various properties of
    //! `Foldable` structures, and is used across the documentation. Also
    //! note that `Iterable`s define an [extended version](@ref Iterable-lin)
    //! of this allowing for infinite structures.
    //!
    //!
    //! Provided conversion to any `Sequence`
    //! -------------------------------------
    //! In the spirit of the notion of linearization presented above, any
    //! `Foldable` can be converted to a `Sequence`. The result is, as one
    //! might expect, simply the linearization of the `Foldable` structure.
    //! More specifically, given a `Foldable` `xs` with a linearization of
    //! `[x1, ..., xn]` and a `Sequence` `S`, `to<S>(xs)` is equivalent to
    //! `make<S>(x1, ..., xn)`.
    //! @snippet example/foldable.cpp conversion
    //!
    //!
    //! Compile-time Foldables
    //! ----------------------
    //! A compile-time `Foldable` is a `Foldable` whose total length is known
    //! at compile-time. In other words, it is a `Foldable` whose `length`
    //! method returns a `Constant` of an unsigned integral type. When
    //! folding a compile-time `Foldable`, the folding can be unrolled,
    //! because the final number of steps of the algorithm is known at
    //! compile-time.
    //!
    //! Additionally, the `unpack` method is only available to compile-time
    //! `Foldable`s. This is because the return _type_ of `unpack` depends
    //! on the number of objects in the structure. Being able to resolve
    //! `unpack`'s return type at compile-time hence requires the length of
    //! the structure to be known at compile-time too.
    //!
    //! __In the current version of the library, only compile-time `Foldable`s
    //! are supported.__ While it would be possible in theory to support
    //! runtime `Foldable`s too, doing so efficiently requires more research.
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! (`fold.left` and `fold.right`) or `unpack`
    //!
    //!
    //! Free model for builtin arrays
    //! -----------------------------
    //! Builtin arrays whose size is known can be folded as-if they were
    //! homogeneous tuples. However, note that builtin arrays can't be
    //! made more than `Foldable` (e.g. `Iterable`) because they can't
    //! be empty and they also can't be returned from functions.
    //!
    //!
    //! Concrete models
    //! ---------------

    struct Foldable { };

    //! Fold a structure using a binary operation and (optionally) an initial
    //! reduction state.
    //! @relates Foldable
    //!
    //! Generally speaking, folding refers to the concept of summarizing a
    //! complex structure as a single value, by successively applying a
    //! binary operation which reduces two elements of the structure to a
    //! single value. Folds come in many flavors; left folds, right folds,
    //! folds with and without an initial reduction state, and their monadic
    //! variants. This method can be used to access all of the non-monadic
    //! fold variants, by using the different syntaxes documented below.
    //! Here's a summary of the different folds:
    //! @code
    //!     fold.left(xs, state, f) = see below
    //!     fold.left(xs, f) = see below
    //!     fold = fold.left
    //!
    //!     fold.right(xs, state, f) = see below
    //!     fold.right(xs, f) = see below
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! In the above, `xs` is always the structure to be folded. Similarly,
    //! `state` is an initial value to use as the accumulation state.
    //!
    //! When the structure is empty, two things may arise. If an initial
    //! state was provided, it is returned as-is. Otherwise, if the no-state
    //! version of the method was used, an error is triggered. When the
    //! stucture contains a single element and the no-state version of the
    //! method was used, that single element is returned as is. This behavior
    //! is consistent with what happens for empty structures with a provided
    //! initial state.
    //!
    //!
    //! ## Left folds (`fold.left`)
    //! `fold.left` is a left-associative fold using a binary operation.
    //! Given a structure containing `x1, ..., xn`, a function `f` and
    //! optionnally an initial state, `fold.left` applies `f` as follows
    //! @code
    //!     f(... f(f(f(x1, x2), x3), x4) ..., xn) // without state
    //!     f(... f(f(f(f(state, x1), x2), x3), x4) ..., xn) // with state
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! ### Signature
    //! Given a `Foldable` `xs` of data type `F(T)`, a function
    //! \f$ f : S \times T \to S \f$ and an initial state `s` of
    //! data type `S`, the signatures for `fold.left` are
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{fold.left} : F(T) \times S \times (S \times T \to S) \to S
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant with an initial state, and
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{fold.left} : F(T) \times (T \times T \to T) \to T
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant without an initial state.
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The structure to fold.
    //!
    //! @param state
    //! The initial value used for folding.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A binary function called as `f(state, x)`, where `state` is the
    //! result accumulated so far and `x` is an element in the structure.
    //! For left folds without an initial state, the function is called as
    //! `f(x1, x2)`, where `x1` and `x2` are elements of the structure.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! `fold` is equivalent to `fold.left`, so `fold(xs, f)` and
    //! `fold(xs, state, f)` are equivalent to `fold.left(xs, f)` and
    //! `fold.left(xs, state, f)` respectively. This is provided solely
    //! for convenience.
    //!
    //! ### Example
    //! @snippet example/foldable.cpp fold.left
    //!
    //!
    //! ## Right folds (`fold.right`)
    //! `fold.right` is a right-associative fold using a binary operation.
    //! Given a structure containing `x1, ..., xn`, a function `f` and
    //! optionnally an initial state, `fold.right` applies `f` as follows
    //! @code
    //!     f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, f(x4, ... f(xn-1, xn) ... )))) // without state
    //!     f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, f(x4, ... f(xn, state) ... )))) // with state
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! It is worth noting that the order in which the binary function should
    //! expect its arguments is reversed from `fold.left`.
    //!
    //! ### Signature
    //! Given a `Foldable` `xs` of data type `F(T)`, a function
    //! \f$ f : T \times S \to S \f$ and an initial state `s` of
    //! data type `S`, the signatures for `fold.right` are
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{fold.right} : F(T) \times S \times (T \times S \to S) \to S
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant with an initial state, and
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{fold.right} : F(T) \times (T \times T \to T) \to T
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant without an initial state.
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The structure to fold.
    //!
    //! @param state
    //! The initial value used for folding.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A binary function called as `f(x, state)`, where `state` is the
    //! result accumulated so far and `x` is an element in the structure.
    //! For right folds without an initial state, the function is called as
    //! `f(x1, x2)`, where `x1` and `x2` are elements of the structure.
    //!
    //! ### Example
    //! @snippet example/foldable.cpp fold.right
    //!
    //!
    //! ## Tag-dispatching
    //! All of the different fold variants are tag-dispatched methods
    //! and can be overridden individually. Here is how each variant is
    //! tag-dispatched (where `Xs` is the data type of `xs`):
    //! @code
    //!     fold.left(xs, state, f) -> fold_left_impl<Xs>::apply(xs, state, f)
    //!     fold.left(xs, f)        -> fold_left_nostate_impl<Xs>::apply(xs, f)
    //!
    //!     fold.right(xs, state, f) -> fold_right_impl<Xs>::apply(xs, state, f)
    //!     fold.right(xs, f)        -> fold_right_nostate_impl<Xs>::apply(xs, f)
    //! @endcode
    //! `fold` is not tag-dispatched because it is just an alias to `fold.left`.
    //!

    //! Monadic fold of a structure with a binary operation and an optional
    //! initial reduction state.
    //! @relates Foldable
    //!
    //! @note
    //! This assumes the reader to be accustomed to non-monadic folds as
    //! explained by `hana::fold`.
    //!
    //! The `monadic_fold` method is used for left or right folding a
    //! structure with a monadic binary operation and an optional initial
    //! state. Basically, a monadic fold is a fold in which subsequent calls
    //! to the binary function are chained with the monadic `chain` operator
    //! of the corresponding Monad. This allows a structure to be folded in
    //! a custom monadic context. For example, performing a monadic fold with
    //! the Maybe monad would require the binary function to return the result
    //! as a `Maybe`, and the fold would abort and return nothing whenever one
    //! of the accumulation step would fail (i.e. return `nothing`). If,
    //! however, all the reduction steps succeed, then `just` the result
    //! would be returned. Different monads will of course result in
    //! different effects.
    //!
    //! This method can be used to access all of the monadic fold variants,
    //! by using the different syntaxes documented below. Here's a summary:
    //! @code
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.left(xs, state, f) = see below
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.left(xs, f) = see below
    //!     monadic_fold<M> = monadic_fold<M>.left
    //!
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.right(xs, state, f) = see below
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.right(xs, f) = see below
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! In the above, `xs` is always the structure to be folded. Similarly,
    //! `state` is an initial value to use as the accumulation state.
    //!
    //! When the structure is empty, two things may arise. If an initial
    //! state was provided, it is lifted to the given Monad and returned
    //! as-is. Otherwise, if the no-state version of the method was used,
    //! an error is triggered. When the stucture contains a single element
    //! and the no-state version of the method was used, that single element
    //! is lifted into the given Monad and returned as is. This behavior is
    //! consistent with what happens for empty structures with a provided
    //! initial state.
    //!
    //!
    //! ## Monadic left folds (`monadic_fold<M>.left`)
    //! `monadic_fold<M>.left` is a left-associative monadic fold. Given a
    //! structure containing `x1, ..., xn`, a function `f` and an optional

    //! @code
    //!     // with state
    //!     ((((f(state, x1) | f(-, x2)) | f(-, x3)) | ...) | f(-, xn))

    //! @param f
    //! A binary function called as `f(x, state)`, where `state` is the result

    //! All of the different monadic fold variants are tag-dispatched methods
    //! and can be overridden individually. Here is how each variant is
    //! tag-dispatched (where `Xs` is the data type of `xs`):
    //! @code
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.left(xs, state, f) -> monadic_fold_left_impl<Xs>::apply<M>(xs, state, f)
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.left(xs, f)        -> monadic_fold_left_nostate_impl<Xs>::apply<M>(xs, f)
    //!
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.right(xs, state, f) -> monadic_fold_right_impl<Xs>::apply<M>(xs, state, f)
    //!     monadic_fold<M>.right(xs, f)        -> monadic_fold_right_nostate_impl<Xs>::apply<M>(xs, f)
    //! @endcode
    //! `monadic_fold<M>` is not tag-dispatched, because it is just an alias
    //! to `monadic_fold<M>.left`.

    //! Compute the sum of the numbers of a structure.

    //!
    //! More generally, `sum` will take any foldable structure containing
    //! objects forming a Monoid and reduce them using the Monoid's binary
    //! operation. The initial state for folding is the identity of the
    //! Monoid. It is sometimes necessary to specify the Monoid to use;
    //! this is possible by using `sum<M>`. If no Monoid is specified,
    //! the structure will use the Monoid formed by the elements it contains
    //! (if it knows it), or `IntegralConstant<int>` otherwise. Hence,
    //! @code
    //!     sum<M>(xs) = fold.left(xs, zero<M or inferred Monoid>(), plus)
    //!     sum<> = sum<IntegralConstant<int>>
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! For numbers, this will just compute the sum of the numbers in the
    //! `xs` structure.
    //!
    //!
    //! @note
    //! The elements of the structure are not actually required to be in the
    //! same Monoid, but it must be possible to perform `plus` on any two
    //! adjacent elements of the structure, which requires each pair of
    //! adjacent element to at least have a common Monoid embedding. The
    //! meaning of "adjacent" as used here is that two elements of the
    //! structure `x` and `y` are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent
    //! in the linearization of that structure, as documented by the Iterable
    //! concept.
    //!
    //!
    //! Why must the Monoid be specified sometimes?
    //! -------------------------------------------
    //! This is because sequences like Tuple are not parameterized data
    //! types (by design). Hence, we do not know what kind of objects are
    //! in the sequence, and so that must be specified explicitly. Other
    //! foldable structures like Ranges will ignore the suggested Monoid
    //! because they know the data type of the objects they contain. This
    //! inconsistent behavior is a limitation of the current design of data
    //! types, and work is being done to resolve it.
