    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Sequence` concept represents generic index-based sequences.
    //!
    //! Compared to other abstract concepts, the Sequence concept is very
    //! specific. It represents generic index-based sequences. The reason
    //! why such a specific concept is provided is because there are a lot
    //! of models that behave exactly the same while being implemented in
    //! wildly different ways. It is useful to regroup all those data types
    //! under the same umbrella for the purpose of generic programming.
    //!
    //! In fact, models of this concept are not only _similar_. They are
    //! actually _isomorphic_, in a sense that we define below, which is
    //! a fancy way of rigorously saying that they behave exactly the same
    //! to an external observer.
    //!
    //!
    //! Laws
    //! ----
    //! For any Sequence data type `S`, the `to<Tuple>` conversion from `S`
    //! (as a Foldable, see below) must be a natural isomorphism. Furthermore,
    //! it must be the unique (up to implementation) bijective natural
    //! MonadPlus and Iterable isomorphism between `Tuple` and `S`.
    //! Intuitively, this means that all Sequences act exactly like `Tuple`s,
    //! but their implementation may differ. This is ensured by stating that
    //! conversion to and from a `Tuple` preserves both information quantity
    //! and organization.
    //!
    //! First, information quantity is preserved by requiring `to<Tuple>`
    //! to be bijective. Hence, the `S` and `Tuple` data types contain the
    //! same amount of objects, and information quantity is preserved. Note
    //! that we explicitly require the isomorphism to be bijective because
    //! [not all isomorphisms are bijective][1].
    //!
    //! Then, information organization is preserved by requiring `to<Tuple>`
    //! to be the unique natural MonadPlus isomorphism between `Tuple` and
    //! `S`. Since everything in Sequence is implemented in terms of MonadPlus,
    //! Iterable and other superclasses, this effectively gives us laws that
    //! must be respected for the methods of Sequence. The result is that for
    //! any Sequence `xs` of data type `S` and any n-ary function `f` (suppose
    //! without loss of generality that `f` takes its Sequence argument in the
    //! first parameter),
    //! @code
    //!     to<Tuple>(f(xs, -, ..., -)) == f(to<Tuple>(xs), -, ..., -)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! If `f` does not return a Sequence, then simply change the above for
    //! @code
    //!     f(xs, -, ..., -) == f(to<Tuple>(xs), -, ..., -)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Here, the notation `f(xs, -, ..., -)` denotes the partial application
    //! of the function `f` to its `xs` argument, with all the other arguments
    //! left unbound. Hence, these comparisons are comparisons between
    //! functions, and they express the fact that any Sequence is just
    //! as good as a `Tuple` for an external observer (the function `f`).
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! 1. `Iterable`, `empty`, `prepend`, `models`\n
    //! The `Sequence` concept does not provide basic methods that could be
    //! used as a minimal complete definition; instead, it borrows methods from
    //! other concepts and add laws to them. For this reason, it is necessary
    //! to specialize the `models` metafunction in the `boost::hana` namespace
    //! in addition to defining the above methods. Explicitly specializing the
    //! `models` metafunction can be seen like a seal saying "this data type
    //! satisfies the additional laws of a `Sequence`", since those can't be
    //! checked by Hana automatically.
    //!
    //!
    //! Superclasses
    //! ------------
    //! 1. `Comparable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! Two `Sequence`s are equal if and only if they contain the same number
    //! of elements and their elements at any given index are equal.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Comparable
    //!
    //! 2. `Orderable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! `Sequence`s are ordered using the traditional lexicographical ordering.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Orderable
    //!
    //! 3. `Functor` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! `Sequence`s implement `transform` as the mapping of a function over
    //! each element of the sequence. This is somewhat equivalent to what
    //! `std::transform` does to ranges of iterators. Also note that mapping
    //! a function over an empty sequence returns an empty sequence and never
    //! applies the function, as would be expected.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Functor
    //!
    //! 4. `Applicative` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! First, `lift`ing a value into a `Sequence` is the same as creating a
    //! singleton sequence containing that value. Second, applying a sequence
    //! of functions to a sequence of values will apply each function to
    //! all the values in the sequence, and then return a list of all the
    //! results. In other words,
    //! @code
    //!     ap([f1, ..., fN], [x1, ..., xM]) == [
    //!         f1(x1), ..., f1(xM),
    //!         ...
    //!         fN(x1), ..., fN(xM)
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //! Example:
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Applicative
    //!
    //! 5. `Monad` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! First, `flaten`ning a `Sequence` takes a sequence of sequences and
    //! concatenates them to get a larger sequence. In other words,
    //! @code
    //!     flatten([[a1, ..., aN], ..., [z1, ..., zM]]) == [
    //!         a1, ..., aN, ..., z1, ..., zM
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //! This acts like a `std::tuple_cat` function, except it receives a
    //! sequence of sequences instead of a variadic pack of sequences to
    //! flatten.\n
    //! __Example__:
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Monad.ints
    //!
    //! Also note that the model of `Monad` for `Sequence`s can be seen as
    //! modeling nondeterminism. A nondeterministic computation can be
    //! modeled as a function which returns a sequence of possible results.
    //! In this line of thought, `chain`ing a sequence of values into such
    //! a function will return a sequence of all the possible output values,
    //! i.e. a sequence of all the values applied to all the functions in
    //! the sequences.\n
    //! __Example__:
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Monad.types
    //!
    //! 6. `MonadPlus` (minimal complete definition modified)\n
    //! `Sequence`s are models of the `MonadPlus` concept by considering the
    //! empty sequence as the unit of `concat`, and sequence concatenation
    //! as the combining operation. Note that the minimal complete definition
    //! of `Sequence` includes the `prepend` and the `empty` methods, which
    //! are part of the `MonadPlus` concept. When those methods are provided,
    //! the `concat` method is automatically defined and hence it is not
    //! strictly required to implement it in order to model `MonadPlus`.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp MonadPlus
    //!
    //! 7. `Foldable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! The model of `Foldable` for `Sequence`s is uniquely determined by the
    //! model of `Iterable`. The automatically provided model is the one
    //! provided by the `Iterable` concept.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Foldable
    //!
    //! 8. `Iterable`\n
    //! The model of `Iterable` for `Sequence`s corresponds to iteration over
    //! each element of the sequence, in order.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Iterable
    //!
    //! 9. `Searchable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! Searching through a `Sequence` is equivalent to just searching through
    //! a list of the values it contains. The keys and the values on which
    //! the search is performed are both the elements of the sequence.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Searchable
    //!
    //! 10. `Traversable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! The model of `Traversable` for `Sequence`s allows turning a sequence
    //! of `Applicative`s into an `Applicative` containing a sequence.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp Traversable
    //!
    //!
    //! Free `make` method
    //! ------------------
    //! For any `Sequence` `S`, the `make<S>` method is defined
    //! automatically as
    //! @code
    //!     make<S>(x1, ..., xn) == fold.right(make<Tuple>(x1, ..., xn), prepend, empty<S>())
    //!                          == [x1, ..., xn] // of data type S
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! While this definition is correct, it can be compile-time inefficient.
    //! Hence, implementers of new sequences are encouraged to override this
    //! default definition.
    //!
    //!
    //! Concrete models
    //! ---------------
    //! `Tuple`

    //! original sequences. For this method to finish, a finite number
    //! of finite sequences must be provided.
    //!
    //! All the sequences must have the same data type, and that data type
    //! must also match that of the top-level sequence. In other words,
    //! the sequence must be of the form
    //! @code
    //!     make_sequence(
    //!         make_sequence(...),
    //!         ...
    //!         make_sequence(...)

    //! Group adjacent elements of a sequence that all respect a binary
    //! predicate, by default equality.
    //! @relates Sequence
    //!
    //! Given a Sequence and an optional predicate (by default `equal`),
    //! `group` returns a sequence of subsequences representing groups of
    //! adjacent elements that are "equal" with respect to the predicate.
    //! In other words, the groups are such that the predicate is satisfied
    //! when it is applied to any two adjacent elements in that group.
    //! The sequence returned by `group` is such that the concatenation of
    //! its elements is equal to the original sequence, which is equivalent
    //! to saying that the order of the elements is not changed.
    //!
    //! If no predicate is provided, adjacent elements in the sequence must
    //! all be compile-time `Comparable`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Signature
    //! ---------
    //! Given a Sequence `s` of data type `S(T)`, a Logical `Bool` and a
    //! predicate \f$ pred : T \times T \to Bool \f$, `group` has the
    //! following signatures. For the variant with a provided predicate,
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{group} : S(T) \times (T \times T \to Bool) \to S(S(T))
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant without a custom predicate, the `T` data type is
    //! required to be Comparable. The signature is then
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{group} : S(T) \to S(S(T))
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The sequence to split into groups.
    //!
    //! @param predicate
    //! A binary function called as `predicate(x, y)`, where `x` and `y`
    //! are _adjacent_ elements in the sequence, and returning a `Logical`
    //! representing whether both elements should be in the same group
    //! (subsequence) of the result. The result returned by `predicate` has
    //! to be a `Constant Logical`. Also, `predicate` has to define an
    //! equivalence relation as defined by the `Comparable` concept.
    //! When this predicate is not provided, it defaults to `equal`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Syntactic sugar (`group.by`)
    //! ----------------------------
    //! `group` can be called in a third way, which provides a nice syntax
    //! especially when working with the `comparing` combinator:
    //! @code
    //!     group.by(predicate, xs) == group(xs, predicate)
    //!     group.by(predicate) == group(-, predicate)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! where `group(-, predicate)` denotes the partial application of
    //! `group` to `predicate`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Tag dispatching
    //! ---------------
    //! Both the non-predicated version and the predicated versions of `group`
    //! are tag-dispatched methods, and hence they can be customized
    //! independently. Here is how the different versions of `group`
    //! are dispatched:
    //! @code
    //!     group(xs) -> group_impl<data type of xs>::apply(xs)
    //!     group(xs, pred) -> group_pred_impl<data type of xs>::apply(xs, pred)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Also note that `group.by` is not tag-dispatched on its own, since it
    //! is just syntactic sugar for calling the corresponding `group`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp group

    //! Fold a Sequence and return a list containing the successive reduction
    //! states.
    //! @relates Sequence
    //!
    //! Like `fold`, `scan` reduces a sequence to a single value. However,
    //! unlike `fold`, it builds up a sequence of the intermediary results
    //! computed along the way and returns that instead. In the same way as
    //! `fold` comes with several variants (left/right folds, with/without
    //! an initial state), `scan` offers the same 4 flavors. This method
    //! may be used to access all of these variants by using the different
    //! syntaxes documented below. Here is an overview:
    //! @code
    //!     scan.left(xs, state, f) = see below
    //!     scan.left(xs, f) = see below
    //!     scan = scan.left
    //!
    //!     scan.right(xs, state, f) = see below
    //!     scan.right(xs, f) = see below
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! In the above, `xs` is the sequence to be folded, `state` is the
    //! optional initial accumulation state that can be provided, and
    //! `f` is a binary operation used to reduce the sequence.
    //!
    //! When the sequence is empty, two things may arise. If an initial state
    //! was provided, a singleton list containing that state is returned.
    //! Otherwise, if no initial state was provided, an empty list is
    //! returned. In particular, unlike for `fold`, using `scan` on an
    //! empty sequence without an initial state is not an error.
    //!
    //!
    //! ## Left scans (`scan.left`)
    //! `scan.left` is a left associative scan of a sequence. Specifically,
    //! the `i`th element of `scan.left([x1, ..., xn], state, f)` is
    //! equivalent to `fold.left([x1, ..., xi], state, f)`, with the
    //! no-state variant handled analogously. For example, consider this
    //! left fold on a short sequence:
    //! @code
    //!     fold.left([x1, x2, x3], state, f) == f(f(f(state, x1), x2), x3)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! The analogous sequence generated with `scan.left` will be
    //! @code
    //!     scan.left([x1, x2, x3], state, f) == [
    //!         state,
    //!         f(state, x1),
    //!         f(f(state, x1), x2),
    //!         f(f(f(state, x1), x2), x3)
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Similarly, consider this left fold (without an initial state) on
    //! a short sequence:
    //! @code
    //!     fold.left([x1, x2, x3, x4], f) == f(f(f(x1, x2), x3), x4)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! The analogous sequence generated with `scan.left` will be
    //! @code
    //!     scan.left([x1, x2, x3, x4], f) == [
    //!         x1,
    //!         f(x1, x2),
    //!         f(f(x1, x2), x3),
    //!         f(f(f(x1, x2), x3), x4)
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The sequence to fold from the left.
    //!
    //! @param state
    //! The initial value used for folding.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A binary function called as `f(state, x)`, where `state` is the
    //! result accumulated so far and `x` is an element in the sequence.
    //! If no initial state is provided, `f` is called as `f(x1, x2)`,
    //! where `x1` and `x2` are both elements of the sequence.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! `scan` is equivalent to `scan.left`, so `scan(xs, f)` and
    //! `scan(xs, state, f)` are equivalent to `scan.left(xs, f)` and
    //! `scan.left(xs, state, f)` respectively. This is provided solely
    //! for convenience.
    //!
    //! ### Example
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp scan.left
    //!
    //!
    //! ## Right scans (`scan.right`)
    //! `scan.right` is a right associative scan of a sequence. Specifically,
    //! the `i`th element of `scan.right([x1, ..., xn], state, f)` is
    //! equivalent to `fold.right([xi, ..., xn], state, f)`, with the
    //! no-state variant handled analogously. For example, consider this
    //! right fold on a short sequence:
    //! @code
    //!     fold.right([x1, x2, x3], state, f) == f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, state)))
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! The analogous sequence generated with `scan.right` will be
    //! @code
    //!     scan.right([x1, x2, x3], state, f) == [
    //!         f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, state))),
    //!               f(x2, f(x3, state)),
    //!                     f(x3, state),
    //!                           state
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Similarly, consider this right fold (without an initial state) on
    //! a short sequence:
    //! @code
    //!     fold.right([x1, x2, x3, x4], f) == f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, x4)))
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! The analogous sequence generated with `scan.left` will be
    //! @code
    //!     scan.right([x1, x2, x3, x4], f) == [
    //!         f(x1, f(x2, f(x3, x4))),
    //!               f(x2, f(x3, x4)),
    //!                     f(x3, x4),
    //!                           x4
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The sequence to fold from the right.
    //!
    //! @param state
    //! The initial value used for folding.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A binary function called as `f(x, state)`, where `state` is the

    //! and `predicate(y, x)` are false, then `x` will come before `y` in the
    //! resulting sequence.
    //!
    //! If no predicate is provided, the elements in the sequence must all be
    //! compile-time `Orderable`.
    //!
    //! Signature
    //! ---------
    //! Given a Sequence `s` of data type `S(T)`, a Logical `Bool` and a
    //! predicate \f$ pred : T \times T \to Bool \f$, `sort` has the following
    //! signatures. For the variant with a provided predicate,
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{sort} : S(T) \times (T \times T \to Bool) \to S(T)
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! for the variant without a custom predicate, the `T` data type is
    //! required to be Orderable. The signature is then
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{sort} : S(T) \to S(T)
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! @param xs
    //! The sequence to sort.
    //!
    //! @param predicate
    //! A function called as `predicate(x, y)` for two elements `x` and `y` of
    //! the sequence, and returning a `Logical` representing whether `x` is to
    //! be considered _less_ than `y`, i.e. whether `x` should appear _before_
    //! `y` in the resulting sequence. More specifically, `predicate` must
    //! define a [strict weak ordering][1] on the elements of the sequence.
    //! In the current version of the library, also note that `predicate` must
    //! return a `Constant Logical` when called with any two elements of the
    //! sequence. When the predicate is not specified, this defaults to `less`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Syntactic sugar (`sort.by`)
    //! ---------------------------
    //! `sort` can be called in a third way, which provides a nice syntax
    //! especially when working with the `ordering` combinator:
    //! @code
    //!     sort.by(predicate, xs) == sort(xs, predicate)
    //!     sort.by(predicate) == sort(-, predicate)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! where `sort(-, predicate)` denotes the partial application of
    //! `sort` to `predicate`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Tag dispatching
    //! ---------------
    //! Both the non-predicated version and the predicated versions of `sort`
    //! are tag-dispatched methods, and hence they can be customized
    //! independently. One reason for this is that some structures are
    //! able to provide a much more efficient implementation of `sort`
    //! when the `less` predicate is used. Here is how the different
    //! versions of `sort` are dispatched:
    //! @code
    //!     sort(xs) -> sort_impl<data type of xs>::apply(xs)
    //!     sort(xs, pred) -> sort_pred_impl<data type of xs>::apply(xs, pred)
    //! @endcode
    //!

    //! `unfold<S>.right`, respectively. Also note that for convenience,
    //! `unfold<S>` is an alias to `unfold<S>.left`.
    //!
    //!
    //! ### Fun fact
    //! In some cases, `unfold` can undo a `fold` operation:

    //!     unfold<S>.left(fold.left(xs, z, f), g) == xs

    //! @code
    //!     g(f(x, y)) == just(make_pair(x, y))
    //!     g(z) == nothing
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Signature
    //! ---------
    //! Given a Sequence data type `S`, an initial value `init` of data type
    //! `I`, an arbitrary Product `P` and a function \f$ f : I \to P(I, T) \f$,
    //! `unfold<S>.left` has the following signature:
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{unfold}_S.\mathrm{left} : I \times (I \to P(I, T)) \to S(T)
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! Given a function \f$ f : I \to P(T, I) \f$ instead, `unfold<S>.right`
    //! has the following signature:
    //! \f[
    //!     \mathrm{unfold}_S.\mathrm{right} : I \times (I \to P(T, I)) \to S(T)
    //! \f]
    //!
    //! @tparam S
    //! The data type of the sequence to build up.
    //!
    //! @param init
    //! An initial value to build the sequence from.
    //!
    //! @param f
    //! A function called as `f(init)`, where `init` is an initial value,
    //! and returning
    //! 1. `nothing` if it is done producing the sequence.
    //! 2. otherwise, `just(make_pair(init, x))` for `unfold.left` and
    //!    `just(make_pair(x, init))` for `unfold.right`, where `init` is the
    //!    new initial value used in the next call to `f` and `x` is an
    //!    element to be appended to the resulting sequence. Also note that

    //!
    //!
    //! The `zip` method is actually a function object that can be called in
    //! several different ways, each of them providing a slightly different
    //! kind of zipping. Here are the different ways of calling `zip`:
    //! @code
    //!     zip(s1, ..., sn)         = zip.shortest(s1, ..., sn)
    //!     zip.with(f, s1, ..., sn) = zip.shortest.with(f, s1, ..., sn)
    //!
    //!     zip.shortest(s1, ..., sn)         = see below
    //!     zip.shortest.with(f, s1, ..., sn) = see below
    //!
    //!     zip.unsafe(s1, ..., sn)         = see below
    //!     zip.unsafe.with(f, s1, ..., sn) = see below
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! First, one sees that calling `zip` or `zip.with` is equivalent to
    //! calling `zip.shortest` or `zip.shortest.with`, respectively. The
    //! `shortest` variant signifies that the returned sequence should stop
    //! when the shortest input sequence is exhausted, which is the usual
    //! behavior for `zip` operations.
    //!
    //! Then, there are also the `zip.unsafe` and `zip.unsafe.with` variants,
    //! which both assume that all the sequences are of the same size. This
    //! allows the library to perform some optimizations. If you know that
    //! all the sequences you are about to zip are of the same length, you
    //! should use these variants.
    //!
    //! Finally, the `with` variants offer the possibility of providing a
    //! custom function to do the zipping, as was explained above. The
    //! non-`with` variants, which do not accept a custom function, will
    //! zip using a tuple. In other words,
    //! @code
    //!     zip.*(s1, ..., sn) == zip.*.with(make<Tuple>, s1, ..., sn)
    //!                        == [
    //!                             make<Tuple>(s1[0], ..., sn[0]),
    //!                             make<Tuple>(s1[1], ..., sn[1]),
    //!                             ...
    //!                             make<Tuple>(s1[M], ..., sn[M])
    //!                        ]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! All of the different zipping variants are tag-dispatched methods that
    //! can be overridden. Here is how each variant is tag-dispatched:
    //! @code
    //!     zip.shortest       ->  zip_shortest_impl
    //!     zip.shortest.with  ->  zip_shortest_with_impl
    //!     zip.unsafe         ->  zip_unsafe_impl
    //!     zip.unsafe.with    ->  zip_unsafe_with_impl
    //! @endcode
    //! `zip` and `zip.with` are not tag dispatched, because they are
    //! just aliases to `zip.shortest` and `zip.shortest.with`, respectively.
    //! Also note that all the sequences must have the same data type, and
    //! only the data type of the first one is used for tag-dispatching.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! At least one sequence must be provided. Otherwise, it is an error.
    //!
    //!
