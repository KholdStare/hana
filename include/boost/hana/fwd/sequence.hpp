    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Sequence` concept represents generic index-based sequences.
    //!
    //! The Sequence concept is very specific. It represents generic
    //! index-based sequences. The reason why such a specific concept
    //! is provided is because there are a lot of models that behave
    //! exactly the same while being implemented in wildly different
    //! ways. It is useful to regroup all those data types under the
    //! same umbrella for the purpose of generic programming.
    //!
    //! In fact, models of this concept are not only _similar_. They are
    //! actually _isomorphic_, in a sense that we define below, which is
    //! a fancy way of rigorously saying that they behave exactly the same
    //! to an external observer.
    //!
    //!
    //! Laws
    //! ----
    //! @todo
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! 1. `Iterable`, `empty`, `prepend`, and explicitly specialize `models`
    //! The Sequence concept does not provide basic methods that could be used
    //! as a minimal complete definition; it instead borrows methods from
    //! other concepts and add laws to them. For this reason, it is necessary
    //! to specialize the `models` metafunction in the `boost::hana` namespace
    //! in addition to defining the above methods. Defining the `models`
    //! metafunction can be seen like a seal saying "this data type satisfies
    //! the additional laws of a Sequence", even though they can't be checked
    //! syntactically.
    //!
    //!
    //! Superclasses
    //! ------------
    //! 1. `Comparable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! Two `Sequence`s are equal if and only if they contain the same number
    //! of elements and their elements at any given index are equal.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp comparable
    //!
    //! 2. `Orderable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! Sequences are ordered using the traditional lexicographical ordering.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp orderable
    //!
    //! 3. `Traversable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! @todo
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp traversable
    //!
    //! 4. `Functor` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! Sequences implement `transform` as the mapping of a function over
    //! each element of the sequence. This is somewhat equivalent to what
    //! `std::transform` does to ranges of iterators. Also note that mapping
    //! a function over an empty sequence returns an empty sequence and never
    //! applies the function, as would be expected.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp functor
    //!
    //! 5. `Applicative` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! First, `lift`ing a value into a Sequence is the same as creating a
    //! singleton sequence containing that value. Second, applying a sequence
    //! of functions to a sequence of values will apply each function to
    //! all the values in the sequence, and then return a list of all the
    //! results. In other words,
    //! @code
    //!     ap([f1, ..., fN], [x1, ..., xM]) == [
    //!         f1(x1), ..., f1(xM),
    //!         ...
    //!         fN(x1), ..., fN(xM)
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp applicative
    //!
    //! 6. `Monad` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! First, `flaten`ning a Sequence takes a sequence of sequences and
    //! concatenates them to get a larger sequence. In other words,
    //! @code
    //!     flatten([[a1, ..., aN], ..., [z1, ..., zM]]) == [
    //!         a1, ..., aN, ..., z1, ..., zM
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //! Also note that the model of Monad for Sequences can be seen as
    //! modeling nondeterminism. A nondeterministic computation can be
    //! modeled as a function which returns a sequence of possible results.
    //! In this line of thought, `bind`ing such a function to a sequence
    //! of values will return a sequence of all the possible output values,
    //! i.e. a sequence of all the values applied to all the functions in
    //! the sequences.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp monad
    //!
    //! 7. `MonadPlus` (minimal complete definition modified)\n
    //! Sequences are models of the MonadPlus concept by considering the
    //! empty sequence as the unit of `concat`, and sequence concatenation
    //! as the combining operation. Note that the minimal complete definition
    //! of Sequence includes the `prepend` and the `empty` methods, which are
    //! part of the MonadPlus concept. When those methods are provided, the
    //! `concat` method is automatically defined and hence it is not strictly
    //! required to implement it in order to model MonadPlus.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp monad_plus
    //!
    //! 8. `Foldable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! The model of Foldable for Sequences is uniquely determined by the
    //! model of Iterable. The automatically provided model is the one
    //! provided by the Iterable concept.
    //!
    //! 9. `Iterable`\n
    //! @todo
    //!
    //! 10. `Searchable` (definition provided automatically)\n
    //! Searching through a Sequence is equivalent to just searching through
    //! a list of the values it contains. The keys and the values on which
    //! the search is performed are both the elements of the sequence.
    //! @snippet example/sequence.cpp searchable
    //!
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! Implement these methods:
    //! `intercalate`, `transpose`, `subsequences`, `split_at`, `break`,
    //! `inits`, `tails`, `iterate`
    //!
    //! And perhaps also these:
    //! `nub_by`, `nub`, `delete_by`, `insert`, `set_difference_by`,
    //! `set_union_by`, `set_intersection_by`
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! Document the Foldable -> Sequence conversion, and also the
    //! `make` function.

    //! Group the elements of a sequence into subgroups of adjacent elements

    //! Specifically, `group_by` takes a sequence and returns a sequence of
    //! sequences such that the concatenation of the result is equal to the

    //! the predicate is satisfied when applied to two adjacent elements.

    //! representing whether both elements should be in the same group
    //! (subsequence) of the result. The result returned by `predicate` has
    //! to be a `Constant Logical`. Also, `predicate` has to define an

    //! Zip one sequence or more, either with a given function or into a Tuple.
    //! @relates Sequence
    //!
    //! In a general setting, zipping several sequences with a function refers
    //! to the following operation. Given `n` sequences `s1, ..., sn` and a
    //! function `f` that takes `n` arguments, zipping produces a sequence
    //! whose i-th element is `f(s1[i], ..., sn[i])`, where `sk[i]` denotes
    //! the i-th element of the k-th sequence passed as an argument. In other
    //! words, it produces a sequence of the form
    //! @code
    //!     [
    //!         f(s1[0], ..., sn[0]),
    //!         f(s1[1], ..., sn[1]),
    //!         ...
    //!         f(s1[M], ..., sn[M])
    //!     ]
    //! @endcode
    //! , where `M` is usually the length of the shortest sequence. As this
    //! suggests, there are several different ways of zipping that one might
    //! want; zip with a function, zip without a function, zip up to the
    //! shortest sequence, zip up to the longest sequence or assume all the
    //! sequences are of the same size. In Hana, all these different ways of
    //! zipping are provided, except for the "up to the longest sequence" one.
    //!
    //! > #### Rationale for not providing a `zip.longest` variant
    //! > It would require either (1) padding the shortest sequences with

    //!
    //!
    //! The `zip` method is actually a function object that can be called in
    //! several different ways, each of them providing a slightly different
    //! kind of zipping. Here are the different ways of calling `zip`:
    //! @code
    //!     zip(s1, ..., sn)         = zip.shortest(s1, ..., sn)
    //!     zip.with(f, s1, ..., sn) = zip.shortest.with(f, s1, ..., sn)
    //!
    //!     zip.shortest(s1, ..., sn)         = see below
    //!     zip.shortest.with(f, s1, ..., sn) = see below
    //!
    //!     zip.unsafe(s1, ..., sn)         = see below
    //!     zip.unsafe.with(f, s1, ..., sn) = see below
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! First, one sees that calling `zip` or `zip.with` is equivalent to
    //! calling `zip.shortest` or `zip.shortest.with`, respectively. The
    //! `shortest` variant signifies that the returned sequence should stop
    //! when the shortest input sequence is exhausted, which is the usual
    //! behavior for `zip` operations.
    //!
    //! Then, there are also the `zip.unsafe` and `zip.unsafe.with` variants,
    //! which both assume that all the sequences are of the same size. This
    //! allows the library to perform some optimizations. If you know that
    //! all the sequences you are about to zip are of the same length, you
    //! should use these variants.
    //!
    //! Finally, the `with` variants offer the possibility of providing a
    //! custom function to do the zipping, as was explained above. The
    //! non-`with` variants, which do not accept a custom function, will
    //! zip using a tuple. In other words,
    //! @code
    //!     zip.*(s1, ..., sn) == zip.*.with(make<Tuple>, s1, ..., sn)
    //!                        == [
    //!                             make<Tuple>(s1[0], ..., sn[0]),
    //!                             make<Tuple>(s1[1], ..., sn[1]),
    //!                             ...
    //!                             make<Tuple>(s1[M], ..., sn[M])
    //!                        ]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! All of the different zipping variants are tag-dispatched methods that
    //! can be overriden. Here is how each variant is tag-dispatched:
    //! @code
    //!     zip.shortest       ->  zip_shortest_impl
    //!     zip.shortest.with  ->  zip_shortest_with_impl
    //!     zip.unsafe         ->  zip_unsafe_impl
    //!     zip.unsafe.with    ->  zip_unsafe_with_impl
    //! @endcode
    //! `zip` and `zip.with` are not tag dispatched, because they are
    //! just aliases to `zip.shortest` and `zip.shortest.with`, respectively.
    //! Also note that all the sequences must have the same data type, and
    //! only the data type of the first one is used for tag-dispatching.
    //!
    //! @note
    //! At least one sequence must be provided. Otherwise, it is an error.
    //!
