    //! General purpose index-based heterogeneous sequence with a fixed length.
    //!
    //! `Tuple` is the bread and butter for static metaprogramming.
    //! Conceptually, it is exactly the same as a `std::tuple`; it is just
    //! a sequence able of holding objects of different types and whose size
    //! is fixed at compile-time. However, Hana's tuple provides much more
    //! functionality than its `std` counterpart, and it is also much more
    //! efficient than all standard library implementations tested so far.
    //!
    //! `Tuple`s are index-based sequences. If you need an associative
    //! sequence with a key-based access, then you should consider the
    //! `Map` and `Set` data types instead.
    //!
    //!
    //! Modeled concepts
    //! ----------------
    //! `Sequence`, and all its superclasses
    //!
    //!
    //! Provided operators
    //! ------------------
    //! For convenience, operators for methods of the following concepts can
    //! be used with `Tuple`: `Comparable`, `Orderable`, `Monad`, `Iterable`.

    //! Create a `Tuple` containing the given objects.
    //! @relates Tuple
    //!
    //! This is analoguous to `std::make_tuple` for creating Hana tuples.
    //! The elements are held by value inside the resulting tuple, and hence
    //! they are copied or moved in.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @snippet example/tuple.cpp make<Tuple>
    template <>
    constexpr auto make<Tuple> = [](auto&& ...xs) {
        return _tuple<decayed(decltype(xs))...>{forwarded(xs)...};

    //! that using `tuple_t` allows the library to perform some compile-time
    //! optimizations. Also note that the type of the objects returned by
    //! `tuple_t` and an equivalent call to `make<Tuple>` may differ.
    //!
    //!

    //! @snippet example/tuple.cpp tuple_t
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! Implement the optimization.
