namespace boost { namespace hana {
    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Monad` concept represents `Applicative`s with the ability to
    //! flatten nested levels of structure.
    //!
    //! Intuitively, using the Functor-as-a-box analogy, a `Monad` is able
    //! to flatten a box containing a box into just a single box. In other
    //! words, it is able to remove one level of monadic structure. This
    //! allows Monads to combine not only structures, but also functions
    //! returning structures, which turns out to be pretty useful.
    //!
    //! Historically, Monads are a construction coming from category theory,
    //! an abstract branch of mathematics. The functional programming
    //! community eventually discovered how Monads could be used to
    //! formalize several useful things like side effects, which led
    //! to the wide adoption of Monads in that community. However, even
    //! in a multi-paradigm language like C++, there are several constructs
    //! which turn out to be Monads, like `std::optional`, `std::vector` and
    //! others.
    //!
    //! Everybody tries to introduce Monads with a different analogy, and
    //! almost everybody fails. This is called the [Monad tutorial fallacy][1].
    //! We won't fall into this trap here and will let readers who are new to
    //! this concept read one of the many excellent tutorials available online.
    //! Understanding Monads might take time at first, but once you get it, a
    //! lot of patterns will become obvious Monads; this enlightening will be
    //! your reward for the hard work. That being said, there are different
    //! ways of defining a Monad; some will use the `bind` function (`>>=` in
    //! Haskell), others will use `join` (called `flatten` in this library),
    //! and there are probably other ways. In Hana, the Monad laws are written
    //! in term of the monadic composition operator, called `mcompose`, which
    //! we think gives the best intuition on the relation between a Monad and
    //! a Monoid.
    //!
    //!
    //! Laws
    //! ----
    //! In what follows, we use equality between functions as meaning
    //! @code
    //!     f == g  if and only if  f(x) == g(x) for all x
    //! @endcode
    //! This is to simplify writing the laws, which would be tedious otherwise.
    //! For a data type `M` to be a `Monad`, the following must be satisfied
    //! for all functions `f, g, h` with a suitable signature for the
    //! composition to make sense:
    //! @code
    //!     mcompose<M>(lift<M>, f)           == f                                 // left identity
    //!     mcompose<M>(f, lift<M>)           == f                                 // right identity
    //!     mcompose<M>(mcompose<M>(f, g), h) == mcompose<M>(f, mcompose<M>(g, h)) // associativity
    //! @endcode
    //! By comparing with the `Monoid` laws, one can clearly see how these
    //! two structures have something in common.
    //!
    //!
    //! Superclasses
    //! ------------
    //! `Functor` and `Applicative`
    //!
    //!
    //! Provided superclass methods
    //! ---------------------------
    //! 1. `ap`\n
    //! When the minimal complete definition for `Monad` and `Functor` are
    //! both satisfied, it is possible to automatically implement `ap` by
    //! setting
    //! @code
    //!     ap(fs, x) = bind(fs, [](auto f) {
    //!         return transform(x, f);
    //!     })
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! This implementation is provided through the `Monad::ap_impl` type,
    //! which you can use as follows:
    //! @code
    //!     template <>
    //!     struct ap_impl<YourDatatype>
    //!         : Monad::ap_impl<YourDatatype>
    //!     { };
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! 1. `flatten`\n
    //! When `flatten` is defined, `bind` is defined by setting:
    //! @code
    //!     bind(xs, f) = flatten(transform(xs, f))
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! 2. `bind`\n
    //! When `bind` is defined, `flatten` is defined by setting:
    //! @code
    //!     flatten(xs) = bind(xs, id)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //!
    //! Operators
    //! ---------
    //! For convenience, the following operator is provided as an
    //! equivalent way of calling the corresponding method:
    //! @code
    //!     xs | f  ->  bind(xs, f)
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! > Note: `xs | f` was preferred over `xs >>= f` (as in Haskell),
    //! > because `>>=` is right associative in C++, which would make it
    //! > impossible to chain computations.
