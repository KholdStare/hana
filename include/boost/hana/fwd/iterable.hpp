    //! @ingroup group-concepts
    //! The `Iterable` concept represents data structures supporting external
    //! iteration.
    //!
    //! Intuitively, an Iterable can be seen as a kind of container whose
    //! elements can be pulled out one at a time. An Iterable also provides
    //! a way to know when the _container_ is empty, i.e. when there are no
    //! more elements to pull out.
    //!
    //! Iterables are also Foldable; whereas Foldable represents data
    //! structures supporting internal iteration with the ability to
    //! accumulate a result, the Iterable concept allows inverting the
    //! control of the iteration. This is more flexible than Foldable
    //! since it allows e.g. infinite structures to be iterated only in
    //! part, while trying to fold such a structure would never finish.
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! There's a problem; Foldable is more general than Iterable, but there
    //! are some infinite Iterables that can't be folded properly. So both
    //! concepts actually just overlap and there is no superclass relation?
    //!
    //!
    //! Minimal complete definition
    //! ---------------------------
    //! `head`, `tail` and `is_empty`
    //!
    //!
    //! Laws
    //! ----
    //! The laws that must be respected by models of the Iterable concept
    //! essentially make sure that external iteration and internal iteration
    //! over a data structure are well-behaved. Hence, we request that the
    //! models for Iterable and Foldable are consistent. First, let's define
    //! the notion of a _linearization_. For a Foldable data structure `xs`,
    //! the linearization of `xs` is the sequence of all the elements in the
    //! structure, as-if they had been put in a list:
    //! @code
    //!     linearization(xs) = [x1, x2, ..., xn]
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Note that it is always possible to produce such a linearization for a
    //! finite Foldable by setting
    //! @code
    //!     linearization(xs) = foldl(xs, [], prepend)
    //! @endcode
    //! for an appropriate type of Sequence (heterogeneous or not).
    //!
    //! We can now express the laws of Iterable in terms of the linearization.
    //! For any finite Iterable `xs` with linearization `[x1, ..., xn]`, the
    //! following laws must be satisfied:
    //! @code
    //!     head(it) == x1
    //!
    //!     linearization(tail(it)) == tail(linearization(it))
    //!                             == [x2, ..., xn]
    //!
    //!     is_empty(it)  <=>  is_empty(linearization(it))
    //!                   <=>  n == 0
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! This says that linearizing an Iterable and then iterating through it
    //! should be equivalent to iterating through it in the first place. With
    //! the definition of linearization given above, this forces the models of
    //! Foldable and Iterable to be consistent.
    //!
    //!
    //! Superclasses
    //! ------------
    //! 1. `Foldable` (model provided)\n
    //! Every finite Iterable gives rise to a Foldable, and a model of
    //! Foldable is provided for Iterables via the `Iterable::foldr_impl`
    //! and `Iterable::foldl_impl` methods.
    //!
    //! Let `xs` be an Iterable and let `xi` denote the `i`-th element in its
    //! linearization. In other words, `xs` can be linearized as
    //! `[x1, ..., xN]`, where `N` is the number of elements in `xs`. Then,
    //! right-folding `xs` with a binary operation `*` (in infix notation for
    //! legibility) is equivalent to
    //! @code
    //!     x1 * (x2 * ( ... * (xN-1 * xN)))
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! Similarly, left-folding `xs` is equivalent to
    //! @code
    //!     (((x1 * x2) * x3) * ...) * xN
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! In both cases, notice the side of the parentheses. Left-folding
    //! applies `*` in a left-associative manner, whereas right-folding
    //! applies it in a right-associative manner. For associative operations,
    //! i.e. operations such that for all `a`, `b` and `c`,
    //! @code
    //!     (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
    //! @endcode
    //! this makes no difference. Also note that folds with an initial state
    //! are implemented in an analogous way, and they are provided as
    //! `Iterable::foldr1_impl` and `Iterable::foldl1_impl`.
    //!
    //! 2. `Searchable` (model provided)\n
    //! An Iterable can be searched by doing a linear search through the
    //! elements, with the keys and values both being the elements in the
    //! iterable.
    //! @snippet example/iterable.cpp find
    //!
    //!
    //! Operators
    //! ---------
    //! For convenience, the following operator is provided as an
    //! equivalent way of calling the corresponding method:
    //! @code
    //!     xs[n]  ->  at(n, xs)
    //! @endcode
    //! To take advantage of this operator for a type `T`, `T` must inherit
    //! `hana::operators::Iterable_ops<T>`.
    //!
    //!
    //! @todo
    //! - Add perfect forwarding in the methods.
    //! - Use perfect forwarding in `Iterable::find_impl` once Clang
    //!   bug #20619 is fixed.
    //! - Find a proper way to provide member operators.
