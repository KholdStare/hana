    //! @ingroup group-datatypes
    //! The `Lazy` data type implements superficial laziness via a monadic
    //! interface.
    //!
    //! It is important to understand that the laziness implemented by `Lazy`
    //! is only superficial; only function applications made inside the `Lazy`
    //! monad can be made lazy, not all their subexpressions.
    //!
    //!
    //! Modeled concepts
    //! ----------------
    //! 1. `Functor`\n
    //! Applying a function over a lazy value with `transform` returns the
    //! result of applying the function, as a lazy value.
    //! @snippet example/lazy.cpp functor
    //!
    //! 2. `Applicative`\n
    //! A normal value can be lifted into a lazy value by using `lift<Lazy>`.
    //! A lazy function can be lazily applied to a lazy value by using `ap`.
    //!
    //! 3. `Monad` (operators provided)\n
    //! The `Lazy` monad allows combining lazy computations into larger
    //! lazy computations.
    //! @snippet example/lazy.monad.cpp monad
    //!
    //! 4. `Comonad`\n
    //! The `Lazy` comonad allows evaluating a lazy computation to get its
    //! result and lazily applying functions taking lazy inputs to lazy
    //! values. This [blog post][1]  goes into more details about lazy
    //! evaluation and comonads.
    //! @snippet example/lazy.cpp comonad
    //!
    //!
    //! @note
    //! `Lazy` only models a few concepts because providing more functionality
    //! would require evaluating the lazy values in most cases. Since this
    //! raises some issues such as side effects and memoization, the interface
    //! is kept minimal.
    //!
    //!

    struct Lazy { };

    //! Evaluate a lazy value and return it.
    //! @relates Lazy
    //!
    //! Given a lazy expression `expr`, `eval` evaluates `expr` and returns
    //! the result as a normal value. However, for convenience, `eval` can
    //! also be used with nullary and unary function objects. Specifically,
    //! if `expr` does not have the `Lazy` generalized type, it is called
    //! with no arguments at all and the result of that call is returned,
    //! i.e. `expr()` is returned. Otherwise, if `expr()` is ill-formed,
    //! then `expr(hana::id)` is returned instead. If that expression is
    //! ill-formed, then a compile-time error is triggered.
    //!
    //! The reason for allowing nullary callables in `eval` is because this
    //! allows using nullary lambdas as lazy branches to `eval_if`, which
    //! is convenient. The reason for allowing unary callables and calling
    //! them with `hana::id` is because this allows deferring the
    //! compile-time evaluation of selected expressions inside the
    //! callable. How this can be achieve is documented by `eval_if`.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @snippet example/lazy.cpp eval
#ifdef BOOST_HANA_DOXYGEN_INVOKED
    constexpr auto eval = [](auto&& see_documentation) -> decltype(auto) {
        return tag-dispatched;
    };
#else
    // declared in <boost/hana/detail/eval_fwd.hpp>
#endif

    //! Lifts a normal value to a lazy one.
    //! @relates Lazy
    //!
    //! Additionally, `lazy(f)` is a function such that `lazy(f)(x1, ..., xN)`
    //! is equivalent to `ap(lazy(f), lift<Lazy>(x1), ..., lift<Lazy>(xN))`,
    //! which in turn is equivalent to `lazy(f(x1, ..., xN))`, except for the
    //! fact that the inner call to `f` is evaluated lazily. Note that
    //! `lazy(f)()` is equivalent to `lazy(f())`, with the inner call to
    //! `f` being evaluated lazily. This is provided for convenience even
    //! though `ap(lazy(f))` would be invalid because `ap` requires 2
    //! arguments or more.
    //!
    //!
    //! Example
    //! -------
    //! @snippet example/lazy.cpp lazy
