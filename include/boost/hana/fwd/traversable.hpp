    @ingroup group-concepts
    The `Traversable` concept represents types admitting a
    structure-preserving right fold with an `Applicative`.

    Intuitively, the Traversable concept provides the minimal requirement
    for commuting two Applicatives, i.e. for turning a `F(G(T))` into a
    `G(F(T))`, where `F` and `G` are two Applicatives. For example, this
    could allow turning a tree of lists into a list of trees, because
    the tree is Traversable and the list is (in particular) an Applicative.

    The ability to commute structures is fundamental when trying to
    compose Monads. For example, suppose that `M` and `N` are Monads (thus
    they are also Applicatives), and that we want to build the composition
    of `M` and `N` given by `Z(T) = M(N(T))` for any type `T`. If we want
    the composition to be a Monad, we will need to implement the `flatten`
    method, whose signature is then
    @f[
        \mathrm{flatten} : Z(Z(T)) \to Z(T)
    @f]

    which is equivalent to
    @f[
        \mathrm{flatten} : M(N(M(N(T)))) \to M(N(T))
    @f]

    To be able to implement `flatten`, one has to be able to commute
    `N` and `M`, and then use the `flatten` of each Monad `M` and `N`
    to produce a value of the correct type. In other words, we want to do
    @f{align*}{
        M(N(M(N(T)))) &\to M(M(N(N(T)))) & (\text{commute $M$ and $N$}) \\
                      &\to M(M(N(T)))    & (\text{flatten $N$})         \\
                      &\to M(N(T))       & (\text{flatten $M$})
    @f}

    Hence, the composition of two monads `M` and `N` will be a Monad
    whenever `M` is Traversable. The ability to commute structures in
    this way is exactly what the `sequence` method provides.


    Superclasses
    ------------
    `Functor`, `Foldable`


    Minimal complete definition
    ---------------------------
    1. `sequence`\n
    When `sequence` is defined, `traverse` can be obtained by setting
    @code
        traverse<A>(xs, f) = sequence<A>(transform(xs, f))
    @endcode

    2. `traverse`\n
    When `traverse` is defined, `sequence` can be obtained by setting
    @code
        sequence<A>(xs) = traverse<A>(xs, id)
    @endcode


    Concrete models
    ---------------
    `Either`, `Maybe`, `Tuple`


    Laws
    ----
    In the laws below, we use the `Identity` and `Compose` functors
    defined [here][1]. Note that those functors are not provided by
    Hana and they are only used here for documentation purposes.

    Let `A`, `B` be arbitrary Applicatives, and let `xs` be a Traversable
    of data type `T(A(X))`. Then, for any @ref applicative-transformation
    @f$ f : A(X) \to B(X) @f$, the following must hold. First, `sequence`
    must _play well_ with `transform`:
    @code
        // naturality
        f(sequence<A>(xs)) == sequence<B>(transform(xs, f))
    @endcode

    Second, using `sequence` with the Identity functor must not do
    anything special, which means that `sequence` can't make up
    arbitrary effects:
    @code
        // identity
        sequence<Identity>(transform(xs, make<Identity>)) == make<Identity>(xs)
    @endcode

    Finally, for any Traversable `xxs` of data type `T(A(B(X)))`, doing
    two traversals in sequence (commuting from `T(A(B(X)))` to `A(B(T(X)))`)
    must be collapsible into a single traversal:
    @code
        // composition
        sequence<Compose>(transform(xxs, make<Compose>))
            == make<Compose>(transform(sequence<A>(xxs), sequence<B>))
    @endcode
